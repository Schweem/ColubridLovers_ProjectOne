## Overview 
A produtivity tool that features a calendar, to-do list, reading list, doodle space, academic resources, and more. 

## Scheduler
The scheduler is the page that opens when you immediately click on the link to open the program. By default,
it shows a calendar containing all of the events occurring this month, but using the buttons in the bottom left corner, 
you can switch between being able to scroll to view the calendar for the entire semester, as well as viewing the calendar 
one week at a time, or switching to the Day view, which will take you to the To-Do list.
Marking the item as complete in the scheduler view will put a strikethrough on the text in the event, and remove it from the To-Do list. 
Adding a new event is as simple as either clicking on a calendar day or clicking on the plus button in the bottom right corner, prompting
you with this form to add an event.

## To-Do List
This is the To-Do list view. Adding items is as simple as clicking the plus button in the bottom right, prompting you with a form
to add an item. To add a strikethrough for the item you can click on the “Mark as Complete” button next to the item, or you can
delete the item from your To-Do list by clicking the delete button. Clicking the “Print this page” button will pop up a browser
window where you can either print your entire To-Do list page or save it as a PDF.

## Reading List
This is the reading list view. Here you can add links for things that you need to read by clicking the plus icon on the bottom left.
Here you can add the title, author, a link, and the type of reading for that item. In the main view for the reading list,
you can mark an item as complete using the checkbox next to it to apply a strikethrough effect, and there is the red
“Clear all read items” button in the bottom right corner for you to delete all of the items you have finished reading at once.

## Class List
This is the class list view. Here you can view the classes you’re currently taking or have already completed, 
as well as what attributes that class has (whether it’s a CYC class, a specific elective credit, etc.)
You can delete classes by clicking the red “delete” button on the right of a class, and add classes by clicking
the blue plus icon in the bottom right.

## Pomodoro Timer
This is the cute Pomodoro timer view! Here we have a simple timer that you can start, pause with the stop button, or reset. 
Selecting each of the blue buttons above the timer will set the countdown timer to different lengths based on the 
pomodoro method (5 minutes for short break, 25 minutes for pomodoro, and 10 minutes for long break).
Upon running down the timer will pop up an alert that it has finished.

## Doodle Space
This is the doodle space view. The actual drawing space consists of the rectangle on the right, which can be cleared using 
the clear canvas button in the toolbar on the left, or saved and downloaded as an image using the “save as image” button. 
You can use the brush tool to draw with a specific color (chosen using the radio buttons at the bottom of the toolbar),
or the erase tool to erase. You can also use the rectangle, circle, and triangle shape tools to draw a shape in the drawing space, 
and checking the “fill color” checkbox will fill in that shape with the color you have selected, otherwise it will just draw the 
outline of the shape.

## Memes
This is our memes view! In case you’re looking for inspiration, simply click the “get inspired” button and a random specially-curated 
motivational meme will be shown to you!
